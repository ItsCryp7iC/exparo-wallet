# Exparo Wallet

Exparo is a free and open-source **money management android app** designed to help you keep track of your personal finances with ease. It's written using **100% Kotlin and Jetpack Compose**. Think of Exparo as a modern, manual expense tracker that replaces the good old spreadsheet for managing your finances.

## Why Use a Money Management App?

A good money management app can help you answer critical questions about your financial health. 
Ask yourself:

1.  How much money do I have in total?
2.  How much did I spend this month, and what did I spend it on?
3.  How much can I spend and still meet my financial goals?

Exparo is built to help you find these answers.
